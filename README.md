# Algorithm

My algorithm practice sandbox. How fun!

## Code Stability & Maturity

Codes are in one of three states. Although most of them are in State 2 or 3, I didn't make a note in the code. So, if you are algorithm novice like me, please don't assume the code is stable and you can learn from it. It would be safer to take code from somewhere else, more trustworthy
sites. ;-)

**State 1** Just copied from internet or books. I didn't run or debug it yet. It may be the cases that I even didn't finish typing yet.  

**State 2** Copied from internet or books. I ran it and understand how it works. Added comments or modified code to reflect my understanding.

**State 3** I fully understand the algorithm, some of which I wrote from scratch.
